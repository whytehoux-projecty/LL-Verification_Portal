**Summary from the review:**

The project is assessed to be **90% complete** and is considered a functional MVP. Before full production launch, the following steps are recommended:

1.  **Implement Mocked Features:** Connect the AI script analysis and session reporting features to real data.
2.  **Enhance Testing:** Implement formal testing suites (e.g., Pytest, Vitest) to ensure long-term stability.
3.  **Finalize Deployment Configuration:** Harden all production configurations, especially for NGINX and database services.
