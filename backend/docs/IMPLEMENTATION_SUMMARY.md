**Summary from the review:**

The backend is assessed to be **95% complete**. It is a robust, scalable, and secure FastAPI application. The entire API required for the core application workflow is fully implemented. The database schema is well-designed, and the real-time agent integration is solid. Remaining work consists of final production hardening and implementing the transcript-saving mechanism within the agent's lifecycle.
